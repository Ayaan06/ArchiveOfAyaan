# ArchiveOfAyaan
A digital portfolio documenting my journey as a developer — from learning foundational computer science to building real-world projects across AI, blockchain, and cloud computing.  This archive showcases my growth through hands-on projects, certifications, and experiences that reflect how I learn, build, and evolve as a technologist.

## Portfolio Site

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
- Customize content in:
  - `index.html:1` — page sections and text
  - `assets/style.css:1` — colors, spacing, and theme
  - `assets/main.js:1` — nav toggle and scroll reveal
- Replace placeholder links in the Projects and Contact sections.
- The design uses a dark, tech look with a vertical timeline.

### Project Details Pages

- Each card’s Details button links to a dedicated page:
  - `projects/neon-notes.html:1`
  - `projects/grid-gallery.html:1`
  - `projects/api-starter.html:1`
- To add a new project page:
  1) Duplicate one of the files in `projects/`
  2) Update title, description, features, and links
  3) Add a Details link in `index.html:1` for the new card
